His research interests include:\ntrustworthy large foundation model technologies, addressing critical challenges such as knowledge editing, contextual faithfulness, and safe generation. methodologies for constructing and governing high-quality data, including big graph mining, approximation algorithms, graph compression, and summarization techniques. The arising of LLMs drives most of his interests to trustworthy foundation models, and graph LLMs which brings LLM the ability to understand grpahs, think and model with graphs. With graph LLMs, real world complex and combination problems can be well and trustworthily solved by AGI.

Moreover,EagleMine can identify anomalous micro-clusters (i.e., micro-size groups), which exhibit very similar behavior but deviate away from the majority.\nInspired by the mechanism of human vision and cognitive system,\nEagleMine detects and summarizes micro-clusters (dense blocks) in the histogram with a hierarchical tree structure (WaterLevelTree alg.),and reports the suspiciousness score of each micro-cluster based on the deviation from the normal (TreeExplore alg.). For the large graph, the histogram can be constructed with correlated features of graph nodes, and the micro-clusters correspond to node groups, some of them deviating from the majority and contain anomaly / suspicious objects with high probability.

Instead, we propose to model the transactions using a multipartite graph, and detect the complete flow of money from source to destination using a scalable algorithm, FlowScope.

Existing approaches either require excessively high amounts of labeled and balanced data for classification, or rely on less regularized reconstructions, resulting in lower accuracy in anomaly detection. Therefore, we propose BeatGAN, an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm for time series data. BeatGAN outputs explainable results to pinpoint the anomalous time ticks of an input beat, by comparing them to adversarially generated beats. Its robustness is guaranteed by its regularization of reconstruction error using an adversarial generation approach, as well as data augmentation using time series warping. Experiments show that BeatGAN accurately and efficiently detects anomalous beats in ECG time series, and routes doctors’ attention to anomalous time ticks, achieving accuracy of nearly 0.95 AUC, and very fast inference (2.6 ms per beat). In addition, we show that BeatGAN accurately detects unusual motions from multivariate motion-capture time series data, illustrating its generality.\n","date":1565395200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565395200,"objectID":"e8c5f449333d2ecf844332294b5be551","permalink":"https://bgt-m.github.io/projects/beatgan/","publishdate":"2019-08-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/beatgan/","section":"projects","summary":"","tags":["Graph"],"title":"BeatGAN: Anomalous Rhythm Detection using Adversarially Generated Time Series.","type":"projects"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"EigenPulse is a streaming algorithm to detect surges of sliding windows in real time.\nHow can we spot dense blocks in a large streaming graph efficiently?

However, most existing methods detect dense blocks in a static graph or a snapshot of dynamic graphs, which need to inefficiently rerun the algorithms for a streaming graph. Moreover, some works on streaming graphs are either consuming much time on updating algorithm for every incoming edge, or spotting the whole snapshot of a graph instead of the attacking sub-block. Therefore, we propose a row-augmented matrix with sliding window to model a streaming graph, and design the AugSVD algorithm for computation- and memory-efficient singular decomposition.

Existing approaches such as average degree maximization suffer from the bias of including more nodes than necessary, resulting in lower accuracy and increased need for manual verification. Hence, we propose HoloScope, which uses information from graph topology and temporal spikes to more accurately detect groups of fraudulent users. In terms of graph topology, we introduce contrast suspiciousness, a dynamic weighting approach, which allows us to more accurately detect fraudulent blocks, particularly low-density blocks. In terms of temporal spikes, HoloScope takes into account the sudden bursts and drops of fraudsters’ attacking patterns. In addition, we provide theoretical bounds for how much this increases the time cost needed for fraudsters to conduct adversarial attacks. Additionally, from the perspective of ratings, HoloScope incorporates the deviation of rating scores in order to catch fraudsters more accurately. Moreover, HoloScope has a concise framework and sub-quadratic time complexity, making the algorithm reproducible and scalable. Extensive experiments showed that HoloScope achieved significant accuracy improvements on synthetic and real data, compared with state-of-the-art fraud detection
