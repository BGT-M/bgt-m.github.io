Among these reasoning tasks, graph problems stand out due to their complexity and unique structural characteristics, attracting considerable attention from researchers. Previous studies have explored LLMs' graph reasoning abilities through various techniques, such as different encoding methods for graph structures and the use of carefully designed prompts. However, a critical factor has been mostly overlooked: the prompt sequential order in which graph descriptions are presented to the models. In this study, we present the first comprehensive analysis of how the order of graph descriptions impacts LLM performance. Specifically, we comprehensively evaluate four graph description orders across six graph problems using six mainstream LLMs. The results reveal that: (1) ordered graph descriptions significantly improve LLMs' comprehension of graph structures; (2) the robustness of LLMs to graph description order varies across different tasks; and (3) the impact of graph order on performance is closely related to the inherent characteristics of tasks. This study provides a critical advancement in the application of LLMs for solving graph-related problems, paving the way for future research to optimize model performance through strategic graph description ordering.","tags":null,"title":"Can Graph Descriptive Order Affect Solving Graph Problems with LLMs?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lingrui Mei","Shenghua Liu","Yiwei Wang","Baolong

histogram.\nGiven a histogram for millions of points, what patterns exist in the distributions of point characteristics, and how can we detect them and separate anomalies in a way similar to human

Hence, we propose a vision guided algorithm, EagleMine, to recognize and summarize point groups in the feature spaces. EagleMine utilizes a water-level tree to capture group structures according to vision-based intuition at multiple resolutions, and adopts statistical hypothesis tests to determine the optimal groups along the tree. Moreover,EagleMine can identify anomalous micro-clusters (i.e., micro-size groups), which exhibit very similar behavior but deviate away from the majority.\nInspired by the mechanism of human vision and cognitive system,\nEagleMine detects and summarizes micro-clusters (dense blocks) in the histogram with a hierarchical tree structure (WaterLevelTree alg.),and reports the suspiciousness score of each micro-cluster based on the deviation from the normal (TreeExplore alg.). For the large graph, the histogram can be constructed with correlated features of graph nodes, and the micro-clusters correspond to node groups, some of them deviating from the majority and contain anomaly / suspicious objects with high probability. Correlated features of graph nodes can be: (in / out) Degree, # Triangle, PageRank, Hubness / Authority, Coreness, etc.

Existing graph fraud detection approaches focus on dense subgraph detection, without considering the fact that money laundering involves high-volume flows of funds through chains of bank accounts, thereby decreasing their detection accuracy. Instead, we propose to model the transactions using a multipartite graph, and detect the complete flow of money from source to destination using a scalable algorithm, FlowScope. Theoretical analysis shows that FlowScope provides guarantees in terms of the amount of money that fraudsters can transfer without being detected.

anomalous beats in an effective yet efficient way? For example, how can we detect anomalous beats from electrocardiogram (ECG) readings? Existing approaches either require excessively high amounts of labeled and balanced data for classification, or rely on less regularized reconstructions, resulting in lower accuracy in anomaly detection. Therefore, we propose BeatGAN, an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm for time series data. BeatGAN outputs explainable results to pinpoint the anomalous time ticks of an input beat, by comparing them to adversarially generated beats. Its robustness is guaranteed by its regularization of reconstruction error using an adversarial generation approach, as well as data augmentation using time series warping. Experiments show that BeatGAN accurately and efficiently detects anomalous beats in ECG time series, and routes doctors‚Äô attention to anomalous time ticks, achieving accuracy of nearly 0.95 AUC, and very fast inference (2.6 ms per beat). In addition, we show that BeatGAN accurately detects unusual motions from multivariate motion-capture time series data, illustrating its generality.\n","date":1565395200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565395200,"objectID":"e8c5f449333d2ecf844332294b5be551","permalink":"https://bgt-m.github.io/projects/beatgan/","publishdate":"2019-08-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/beatgan/","section":"projects","summary":"","tags":["Graph"],"title":"BeatGAN: Anomalous Rhythm Detection using Adversarially Generated Time Series.","type":"projects"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"EigenPulse is a streaming algorithm to detect surges of sliding windows in real time.\nHow can we spot dense blocks in a large streaming graph efficiently? Anomalies such as fraudulent attacks, spamming, and DDoS attacks, can create dense blocks in a short time window, emerging a surge of density in a streaming graph. However, most existing methods detect dense blocks in a static graph or a snapshot of dynamic graphs, which need to inefficiently rerun the algorithms for a streaming graph. Moreover, some works on streaming graphs are either consuming much time on updating algorithm for every incoming edge, or spotting the whole snapshot of a graph instead of the attacking sub-block. Therefore, we propose a row-augmented matrix with sliding window to model a streaming graph, and design the AugSVD algorithm for computation- and memory-efficient singular decomposition. EigenP ulse is then proposed to spot the density surges in streaming graphs based on the singular spectrum. We theoretically analyze the robustness of our method. Experiments on real datasets with injections show our perfor- mance and efficiency compared with the state-of-the-art baseline.\n","date":15552e5,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":15552e5,"objectID":"22e2c5db3b049bff0c34ee8f0aeb91e3","permalink":"https://bgt-m.github.io/projects/eigenpulse/","publishdate":"2019-04-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/eigenpulse/","section":"projects","summary":"EigenPulse
