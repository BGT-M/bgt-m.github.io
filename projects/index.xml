&lt;p>Given a histogram for millions of points, what patterns exist in the distributions of point characteristics, and how can we detect them and separate anomalies in a way similar to human vision? Hence, we propose a vision guided algorithm, EagleMine, to recognize and summarize point groups in the feature spaces. EagleMine utilizes a water-level tree to capture group structures according to vision-based intuition at multiple resolutions, and adopts statistical hypothesis tests to determine the optimal groups along the tree. Moreover,EagleMine can identify anomalous micro-clusters (i.e., micro-size groups), which exhibit very similar behavior but deviate away from the majority.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Inspired by the mechanism of human vision and cognitive system,&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>EagleMine detects and summarizes micro-clusters (dense blocks) in the histogram with a hierarchical tree structure (WaterLevelTree alg.),and reports the suspiciousness score of each micro-cluster based on the deviation from the normal (TreeExplore alg.).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For the large graph, the histogram can be constructed with correlated features of graph nodes, and the micro-clusters correspond to node groups, some of them deviating from the majority and contain anomaly / suspicious objects with high probability.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Correlated features of graph nodes can be: (in / out) Degree, # Triangle, PageRank, Hubness / Authority, Coreness, etc.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Graphs and time series are fundamental representations of many key applications in a wide range of&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>online user behaviors, e.g. &lt;em>following in social media&lt;/em>, &lt;em>shopping&lt;/em>, and &lt;em>downloading Apps&lt;/em>,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>finance, e.g. &lt;em>stock tradings, and bank transfers&lt;/em>,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sensor networks, e.g. &lt;em>sensor readings, and smart power grid&lt;/em>, and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>health, e.g. &lt;em>electrocardiogram, photoplethysmogram, and respiratory inductance plethysmography&lt;/em>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In practice, we find that thinking graphs and time series as matrices or tensors can enable us to find &lt;em>efficient (near linear)&lt;/em>, &lt;em>interpretable&lt;/em>, yet &lt;em>accurate&lt;/em> solutions in many applications. Therefore, our goal is developping a collectioin of algorithms on graphs and time series based on tensors (matrix is a 2-mode tensor).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In real world, those tensors are &lt;em>sparse&lt;/em>, and we are required to make use of the sparsity to develop efficient algorithms. That is why we name the package as spartan: sparse tensor analytics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The package named spartan can be imported and run independently as a &lt;em>usual python package&lt;/em>. Everything in package spartan is viewed as a tensor (sparse).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SpecGreedy: Unified Dense Subgraph Detection (Best Student DM paper)</title><link>https://bgt-m.github.io/projects/specgreedy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bgt-m.github.io/projects/specgreedy/</guid><description>&lt;p>Fast Spectral Theory-based Algorithms for unified dense subgraphs detection in large graphs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We propose and formulate the generalized densest subgraph detection problem (GenDS) and fast detection algorithms based on the graph spectral properties and greedy search, i.e., SPECGDS (SpecGreedy) and GEPGDS.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Theory &amp;amp; Correspondences&lt;/em>: The unified formulation, GenDS, subsumes many real problems from different applications; and its optimization is guaranteed by the spectral theory.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Scalable&lt;/em>: Propose fast and scalable algorithms to solve the unified detection problem over large graphs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Effectiveness&lt;/em>: The performance (solution-quality and speedy) of SpecGreedy is verified on 40 real-world networks; and it can find some interesting patterns in real applications, like the sudden bursts in research co-authorship relationships.&lt;/li>

Money laundering refers to criminals using the bank’s services to move massive amounts of illegal money to untraceable destination accounts, in order to inject their illegal money into the legitimate financial system. Existing graph fraud detection approaches focus on dense subgraph detection, without considering the fact that money laundering involves high-volume flows of funds through chains of bank accounts, thereby decreasing their detection accuracy. Instead, we propose to model the transactions using a multipartite graph, and detect the complete flow of money from source to destination using a scalable algorithm, FlowScope. Theoretical analysis shows that FlowScope provides guarantees in terms of the amount of money that fraudsters can transfer without being detected. FlowScope outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in accurately detecting the accounts involved in money laundering, in both injected and real-world data settings.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CatchCore: Catching hierarchical dense subtensor</title><link>https://bgt-m.github.io/projects/catchcore/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bgt-m.github.io/projects/catchcore/</guid><description>&lt;p>CatchCore is a novel framework to detect hierarchical dense cores in multi-aspect data (i.e. tensors).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>CatchCore has the following properties:&lt;/p>

For example, how can we detect anomalous beats from electrocardiogram (ECG) readings? Existing approaches either require excessively high amounts of labeled and balanced data for classification, or rely on less regularized reconstructions, resulting in lower accuracy in anomaly detection. Therefore, we propose BeatGAN, an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm for time series data. BeatGAN outputs explainable results to pinpoint the anomalous time ticks of an input beat, by comparing them to adversarially generated beats. Its robustness is guaranteed by its regularization of reconstruction error using an adversarial generation approach, as well as data augmentation using time series warping. Experiments show that BeatGAN accurately and efficiently detects anomalous beats in ECG time series, and routes doctors’ attention to anomalous time ticks, achieving accuracy of nearly 0.95 AUC, and very fast inference (2.6 ms per beat). In addition, we show that BeatGAN accurately detects unusual motions from multivariate motion-capture time series data, illustrating its generality.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>EigenPulse: Detecting surges in large streaming graphs with row augmentation</title><link>https://bgt-m.github.io/projects/eigenpulse/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bgt-m.github.io/projects/eigenpulse/</guid><description>&lt;p>EigenPulse is a streaming algorithm to detect surges of sliding windows in real time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How can we spot dense blocks in a large streaming graph efficiently? Anomalies such as fraudulent attacks, spamming, and DDoS attacks, can create dense blocks in a short time window, emerging a surge of density in a streaming graph. However, most existing methods detect dense blocks in a static graph or a snapshot of dynamic graphs, which need to inefficiently rerun the algorithms for a streaming graph. Moreover, some works on streaming graphs are either consuming much time on updating algorithm for every incoming edge, or spotting the whole snapshot of a graph instead of the attacking sub-block. Therefore, we propose a row-augmented matrix with sliding window to model a streaming graph, and design the AugSVD algorithm for computation- and memory-efficient singular decomposition. EigenP ulse is then proposed to spot the density surges in streaming graphs based on the singular spectrum. We theoretically analyze the robustness of our method. Experiments on real datasets with injections show our perfor- mance and efficiency compared with the state-of-the-art baseline.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>HoloScope: Topology-and-Spike Aware Fraud Detection</title><link>https://bgt-m.github.io/projects/holoscope/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bgt-m.github.io/projects/holoscope/</guid><description>&lt;p>HoloScope is developped for fraud detection based on graphs, which makes holistic use of several signals, namely connectivity (i.e., topology), temporal bursts and drops, and rating deviation in a systematic way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As online fraudsters invest more resources, including purchasing large pools of fake user accounts and dedicated IPs, fraudulent attacks become less obvious and their detection becomes increasingly challenging. Existing approaches such as average degree maximization suffer from the bias of including more nodes than necessary, resulting in lower accuracy and increased need for manual verification. Hence, we propose HoloScope, which uses information from graph topology and temporal spikes to more accurately detect groups of fraudulent users. In terms of graph topology, we introduce &lt;em>contrast suspiciousness&lt;/em>, a dynamic weighting approach, which allows us to more accurately detect fraudulent blocks, particularly low-density blocks. In terms of temporal spikes, HoloScope takes into account the sudden bursts and drops of fraudsters&amp;rsquo; attacking patterns. In addition, we provide theoretical bounds for how much this increases the time cost needed for fraudsters to conduct adversarial attacks. Additionally, from the perspective of ratings, HoloScope incorporates the deviation of rating scores in order to catch fraudsters more accurately. Moreover, HoloScope has a concise framework and sub-quadratic time complexity, making the algorithm reproducible and scalable. Extensive experiments showed that HoloScope achieved significant accuracy improvements on synthetic and real data, compared with state-of-the-art fraud detection methods.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Heatmap for point list</title><link>https://bgt-m.github.io/projects/heatmap-for-point-list/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bgt-m.github.io/projects/heatmap-for-point-list/</guid><description/></item><item><title>NeuCast for time series forecasting in power grid</title><link>https://bgt-m.github.io/projects/neucast-for-time-series-forecasting-in-power-grid/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bgt-m.github.io/projects/neucast-for-time-series-forecasting-in-power-grid/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
